            <p class = "answer">We are not involved in the shipping process, however <br> we take ~1 - 2 weeks to create your custom earbuds.<br>From then on, its up to the shipping company when <br> arrive.</p>
            <p class = "question">Why wouldn't my doctor allow my ear<br> scan for your product?</p>
            <p class = "answer">The reasons you would be denied include various <br>medical issues. Any kind of potential aural damages <br> are denied access to ear scans for the purpose <br>of our company.</p>
            <p class = "question">What if my earbuds no longer fit my ears?</p>
            <p class = "answer">Don't worry, we won't charge you for a whole new earbud!<br> In the situation that the shape of your ear has grown too<br> much, we will only charge a discounted fee to replace it.<br> You will however be required to get a new scan of your ear.</p>
            <p class = "question">Why would I get this product as opposed<br> to any other earbud?</p>
            <p class = "answer">What makes our earbud superior to others is it's <br> customization! The reason these are better to sleep<br>in than others are the fact that they are a perfect<br>mold of your ear, making them comfortable to lay<br>with.</p>
